### Global Layoff Trends

### Introduction
I analyzed a global layoffs dataset (2020â€“2025) to uncover trends across industries, countries and company stages. Used Python for data cleaning, exploratory analysis and correlation studies, creating clear visualizations to highlight year-over-year changes, sector specific impacts and the weak relationship between funding levels and job security.
