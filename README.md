# Global-Layoff-Trends
Analyzed a global layoffs dataset (2020â€“2025) to identify trends across industries, countries and company stages. Used Python for data cleaning, EDA, correlation analysis and clear visualizations to show year-by-year changes, sector impacts and the weak link between funding and job security.
